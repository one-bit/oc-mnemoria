description: Show recent memories
agent: build

Show me the recent memories from our previous sessions. Use the timeline tool with limit=10 and reverse=true to show the most recent 10 memories.

If $ARGUMENTS is not empty, search for that specific agent (e.g. "plan", "build", "ask", "review") by passing it as the agent parameter.
